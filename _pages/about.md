I am a Senior Image Algorithm Engineer at **OPPO Japan Research Center**, specializing in Computer Vision and Mobile Imaging. I received my Ph.D. from **Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)** in 2025, advised by Prof. Yoshito Otake and Prof. Yoshinobu Sato.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Medical Image Analysis**, and **Active Learning**. I am particularly focused on efficient annotation strategies (Bayesian Active Learning), 3D geometric representation (Point Cloud Analysis), and multimodal predictive modeling.

Currently, I am working on collaborative R&D of mobile camera image algorithms, developing lightweight AI prefusion algorithms for HDR imaging and optimizing optical flow models for mobile devices.

### Research Interests
* **Computer Vision:** HDR Imaging, Optical Flow, ISP Pipeline.
* **Medical AI:** 3D Shape Prediction, Survival Analysis, Segmentation.
* **Machine Learning:** Bayesian Active Learning, Uncertainty Estimation.
